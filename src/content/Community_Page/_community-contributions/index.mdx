The Akash community is global in it’s reach and enourmous in it’s impact. However, due to the size and complexity in the ways members can contribute, there is no central repository of all the content that’s educating and inspiring current and future crypto community members.

The below repository is designed for community members to add Akash educational content they’ve created for review. It’s open to anyone that has developed Akash content.

### What are Community Contributions?

With the Akash community growing rapidly and numerous community members creating Akash related content, the need for a central repository of community content is needed. However, not all content is equal and some content may need a little TLC before being added to the repo.
This guide is a best practices and checklist for getting your contributions added to the Akash Networks community contributions page.

### Content Definitions

There are two types of content that will be added to the Community contributions section of the Akash website:

#### Written Content

This can include any educational, informative or general information about the Akash Network and its ecosystem

#### Video Content

This can include any educational, informative or general information about the Akash Network and its ecosystem

### Content Approvals

Content approvals are fairly straightforward. Content will be approved if:
- It is relevant to the Akash Network
- It is educational, informative or relevant to the Akash Network and its ecosystem
- It has limited grammatical errors

Content will not be approved OR will need updating before approval if:
- It has numerous grammatical errors
- It has no relevance to the Akash Network

### Adding your content

- Make a [Pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request-from-github-desktop)
- Please include the below information in your PR:
  - Title of content [linked URL to content]
  - Author Information [link to author information]
  - Date of Content
  - Overview of Content
  - 2-3 sentences about the information within your content piece
