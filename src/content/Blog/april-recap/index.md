April was all hands on deck to launch Mainnet 3.

We were overwhelmed and inspired by the persistence of our core dev team as well as the coordination from our validators and community members (we love you guys!). 

> “This \[Mainnet 3\] is a huge milestone for Akash Network. We launched the network in March of 2021. After a year of listening to our users, gathering feedback, and optimizing for the developer, we’re excited to deliver an upgrade that demonstrates the capabilities of Akash Network to support decentralized cloud infrastructure, accelerate Web3, and help users move away from centralized cloud service providers.”
> 
> Greg Osuri, Founder of Akash Network and CEO of Overclock Labs

### **Product Progress** 

At block height 5,629,650, we successfully upgraded the network. This upgrade ([v0.16](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases)) introduces enterprise-grade features like persistent storage, necessary for running all high-resource workloads. This enables developers greater flexibility for running real-world applications, like deploying validators and nodes, and expanding applications for the mining community.

Key features that are now available through the v0.16 upgrade include: 

*   Persistent Storage 
    
*   Fractional uAKT
    
*   Authorized Spend

### **Community & Events** 

It was a busy month for the Akash community. We hosted weekly community calls with 1,242 attendees, various contests, and blog bounties that garnered 300 participants. Most notably, we worked with our 31-member Akash Insider community reviewing Testnet 3 challenge submissions. 

The breakdown: 

*   **Akash Insiders**: huge shout out to the Akash Insiders for reviewing thousands of Testnet challenge submissions over the course of the month. We could not have done it without you! If you’re interested in becoming an Akash Insider, click [here](https://akash.network/community#insiders). 
    
*   **Osmosis Meme Competition**: working alongside the Osmosis Ministery of Marketing, we participated in an OSMO/AKT meme contest. The competition was fierce, but only three meme artists were selected as first, second, and third place winners. Click [here](https://twitter.com/OsmoMinistryMkt/status/1517583990412169216) to see all meme submissions. 
    
*   **Daily Telegram Coffee Talks**: this month, we began hosting 30-minute daily coffee talks on our Telegram channel. The first coffee talk was about home office setup, something we all live with in this (almost) post-pandemic world.
