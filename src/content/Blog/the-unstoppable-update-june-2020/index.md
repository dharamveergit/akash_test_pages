We've had a month of milestones! Last week, we concluded Phase 1 of The Akashian Challenge, our incentivized testnet, with 99 active validators from around the world, and moved closer to the launch of our mainnet.  
  
We also _sold out_ of pre-orders for the first production run of our Supermini portable supercomputers, launching later this year.  
  
We’re fortunate to have the support of our Akashian Challengers and new Supermini owners as we materialize the future of the cloud, and the internet. What I’m most excited about is that we’re building a healthy and vital community for the world’s first decentralized cloud computing marketplace.  
  
Stay tuned for the launch of The Akashian Challenge: Phase 2 this month.

Last week, we completed Phase 1 of The Akashian Challenge, our incentivized testnet. The results?

*   **211 Teams**
    
*   **99 Active Validators (for 64 spots at Mainnet)**
    
*   **#2 Largest Testnet in the Cosmos Hub (after Game of Stakes)**
    
*   **#2 Largest Testnet after Ethereum 2.0**
    

During Phase 1, our testnet withstood an AWS outage that brought down the centralized cloud (and internet). It also weathered [a massive zero fee transaction attack](https://medium.com/@novysf/the-outcome-from-akash-testnet-zero-fee-transaction-attack-5fd4aaa68d97). Both the AWS outage and the attack showcased the resilience of our decentralized platform.   
  
Next week, we’ll be sharing information about Phase 2, and CEO Greg Osuri alongside Pylon’s Jack Zampoline will host a live stream with Phase 2 updates and surprise giveaways.

**Superminis Sold Out!**

Early in May, we launched a test online pre-order campaign for a limited production of 300 Superminis launching in late 2020. We’re excited to report that **we sold out within 4 weeks of the campaign launch**.   
  
Supermini leverages Akash’s proprietary cloud and blockchain technologies, developed over five years. The first 300 Superminis will be manufactured and launched in the United States with premium materials and powerful NVIDIA VOLTA processors.  
  
With a Supermini, you can:

*   become an Akash node with no technical knowledge or additional equipment
    
*   earn income by offering your Supermini’s unused compute on Akash’s peer-to-peer cloud computing marketplace
    
*   run machine learning workloads or server applications
    
*   own a private cloud for full control over your data
    

You can [learn more about Supermini](https://akash.network/supermini/) and add yourself to the waitlist.
