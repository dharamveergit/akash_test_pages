**Introducing Akash Founder Level 3 Third Challenge**
-----------------------------------------------------

This week, we present the Third Challenge, our most difficult, which qualifies you to earn 2,000 Akash Tokens (AKT). This is our hardest challenge yet, and it will require greater resourcefulness and collaboration in the community.   
  
Akash is a marketplace for cloud compute that’s encrypted, private, and decentralized, and an important benefit of deployment on Akash is private communications for your community or team.   
  
Last week we enabled you to deploy your own private matrix server with complete sovereignty over your communications. This week you’re tasked with offering computing on the Akash network as a provider.
