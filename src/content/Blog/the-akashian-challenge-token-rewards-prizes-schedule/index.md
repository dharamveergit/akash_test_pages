**Last Thursday, we** [**announced open registration for The Akashian Challenge**](https://akash.network/blog/announcing-the-akashian-challenge-incentivized-testnet/)**, our incentivized testnet.** With a sprawling challenge that encompasses three phases over eight weeks, and massive token rewards--**3,000,000 Akash Tokens (AKT) or 3% of the 100,000,000 AKT** that will ever be pre-mined at genesis--, the competition has attracted registrations from individuals and teams from around the world.

Inspired by ecosystem projects from our partners and friends, such as Cosmos Game of Stakes, Solana Tour de Sol, and Kava Founder Rewards, The Akashian Challenge enables us to strengthen the scalability, security, and usability of our platform, and help us grow a vibrant and robust community.

We invite you to leverage your technical and social cunning to maneuver your way to victory, through a series of tasks that get progressively more difficult. Along the way, you’ll explore different aspects of our decentralized cloud computing platform.

**Validators who persevere will be generously rewarded.**

Ahead of The Akashian Challenge Phase 1 launch this Thursday, April 30th, we’re excited to **announce the schedule and details for token rewards and exclusive prizes (hint: what is** [**the world’s sleekest and most powerful portable supercomputer**](https://akash.network/supermini/)**?).**

**The Akashian Challenge Rewards & Prizes**

**Goals for Incentivization**

- Establish clear objectives for each challenge while ensuring validators’ creative freedom
- Identify desired behavior from validators and reward accordingly
- Ensure participants are rewarded for actual efforts rather than access to capital (level the playing field)
- Design a reward structure to incentivize long term participation instead of short term financial gain
- Maintain fairness throughout the competition

A total of **3 million AKT (3% of AKT)** is allocated for rewards that include:

1.  **64 Finalist Rewards**
2.  **One-Off Challenges**
3.  **Phase Completion**
4.  **Top 5, 10, 20 Finalists**
5.  **Bi-Weekly Winners**
6.  **Bonus Challenges**

**Rewards Schedule**

Below is the proposed reward schedule, and individual rewards may vary depending on the number of participants. We may shuffle rewards as we introduce challenges for each phase.
