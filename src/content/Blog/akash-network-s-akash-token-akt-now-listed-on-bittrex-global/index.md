With the launch of MAINNET 2 in February, Akash Network, also known as the “Airbnb for Cloud Compute,” became the first and only viable decentralized and open-source alternative to centralized cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, who together control over 74% of the $370 billion cloud computing market.

Since launch, MAINNET 2 has averaged 50 Daily Active Leases (DAL) and grown the number of deployments 17x in just the last 2 months, with a total of 4470 deployments since launch.

As the network has grown, so too has the global demand for access to AKT.

**Today, we’re excited to announce that AKT is now listed on Bittrex Global, a top-ranked global exchange, and is available to buy, sell, and trade on the platform.**

Powering high-growth industries including blockchain and machine learning, AKT is Akash’s native utility token and is used as the primary means to govern and secure the network, and provide a default mechanism to store and exchange value.

Bittrex Global is the sixth listing for AKT since Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) in October of 2020, and is also available on AscendEX (Bitmax), Gate.io, BitMart, and DigiFinex.

**Currently, AKT has ~48% APR staking rewards and ~83% bonding rate.**

Our team continues to be focused on expanding liquidity for AKT through decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges.
