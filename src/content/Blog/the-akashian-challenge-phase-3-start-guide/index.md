Anxious to flex your technical chops next Monday November 30, 2020 when The Akashian Challenge Phase 3 Testnet goes live?!

**With 500,000 Akash Token (AKT) in rewards, and participants joining from around the world,** The Akashian Challenge Phase 3 Incentivized Testnet is the final phase of one of the ecosystem’s most successful testnets, and includes a series of guided tasks and open-ended challenges. Akashian Challengers are able to explore different aspects of the world’s first decentralized cloud computing marketplace.

As a decentralized system, we’re leveraging The Akashian Challenge incentivized testnet to gather data, identify critical issues, and ensure our network’s scalability, security, and usability.

**Check out our Phase 3 Start Guide below to help you prepare for the beginning of Phase 3 set to launch next Monday, November 30th.**

####

**Phase 3: Week 1 Start Guide**  
**\_\_\_\_\_**

**The Akashian Challenge Phase 3: Developer Operations will launch on Monday, November 30th at 1700 UTC / 9:00AM PST. Phase 3 will encompass two weeks of challenges.**

**Check out our** [**Phase 3 Overview & Rewards Schedule**](https://akash.network/blog/the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-rewards-overview/) **to plan your strategy!**

The Akashian Challenge Phase 3 will test and showcase Akash DeCloud’s deployment platform. Akashian Challengers will be incentivized to deploy applications using the Akash Network.

Encompassing two weeks, Phase 3 will include guided challenges for deploying applications of increasing complexity — from simple single-page applications to blockchain network components, and open ended challenges where users can show off their Akash OPS skills by extending the guided examples to deploy any application they desire — from DeFi to CI.

There are additional rewards for participation outside of the deployment challenges, including contributions such as active validator and developer participation, writing blog posts and how-to guides, and sharing novel uses of our platform.
