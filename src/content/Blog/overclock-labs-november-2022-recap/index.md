As we close out November, here is a recap of the past month for Overclock Labs and Akash Network.

Akash Network successfully completed the upgrade to Mainnet 4

On November 17th, Akash Network completed the upgrade to Mainnet 4. This upgrade is yet another significant milestone in Akash's ambition to become the leading peer-to-peer marketplace for cloud compute. This upgrade also paves the way for a GPU marketplace on Akash.

The upgrade to Mainnet 4 is the culmination of months of hard work from our engineering team. Now that Mainnet 4 is live, the upgrade’s four major features are now available to everyone on the network:

1.  IP Leases
2.  Provider Services Split
3.  IBC3
4.  Interchain Accounts

We’re thrilled to finally ship Mainnet 4 and provide everyone on Akash access to these powerful features.
