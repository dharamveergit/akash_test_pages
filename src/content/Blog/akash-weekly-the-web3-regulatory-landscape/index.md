Welcome back to another issue of The Akash Weekly Newsletter from the team at Overclock Labs.

Tune into our weekly live Twitter Spaces event held every Wednesday at 8am PT. Featuring Overclock Labs’ CEO & Co-Founder, Greg Osuri, and special guests from around the web3 space.

Our guests this week
- Lourdes C. Miranda — Chief Compliance Officer at Send Crypto
- Alani Bankhead — Lieutenant Colonel & Agent in the Air Force Reserves and Professional Coach & Consultant

## Ecosystem Updates
Hear the ecosystem updates directly from Greg Osuri.

### Akash’s Mainnet 4
In case you missed it — Mainnet 4 is coming in a few weeks. This upgrade will include four main features: IP Leases, Provider Services Split, IBC3, and Interchain Accounts.

### Interchain Accounts
Interchain Accounts (ICA) are coming to Akash Network with the Mainnet 4 upgrade, which is tentatively expected to happen in the first week of November.

ICAs bring a new phase of interoperability to IBC-compatible chains. With Interchain accounts, any IBC chain can call a method on Akash Network from its native account. For example, a Juno account could own a deployment on Akash. This will allows for a widespread cross-pollination of communities within Cosmos and eventually beyond.

### Dimokus Deploys Hypersign via Spheron
Akash Insider, Dimokus, won a bug bounty contest from our ecosystem partner Spheron for building a Hypersign Validator Script for Akash Network.

### A Thread on Akash From Elemental Crypto
Check out this thread from Elemental Crypto on the fundamentals of Akash Network. We always appreciate the efforts of our community and their work in helping to explain our work in building an open and sovereign cloud.

### Google Announces It Will Accept Crypto Payments
On Tuesday, Google announced that it would begin to accept crypto payments for cloud services.

Crypto payments will initially be rolled out to a handful of customers involved in the Web3 industry. Google will also user Coinbase's custody service, Coinbase Prime.

"We want to make building in Web3 faster and easier, and this partnership with Coinbase helps developers get one step closer to that goal," said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud.

## Regulation & Compliance In Web3
We are excited to host this conversation on regulation and compliance in Web3 with our special guests this week. Given the wide-ranging experience and deep expertise of both guests, please find their full bios below:

**Lourdes C. Miranda** — Chief Compliance Officer at Send Crypto. Lourdes Miranda is a former CIA Officer and a former FBI Analyst with over 20 years of government and corporate experience specializing in financial crime investigations and intelligence collection and analysis globally. She has extensive field experience targeting money launderers and terrorist financiers. Since 2017, she has been working with Fintechs as a senior crypto investigator, senior compliance officer, and as a risk manager building compliance, investigations, crypto, and intelligence teams and training programs. Lourdes is also an author and has contributed to ManchesterCF’s Cryptoassets and Open-Source Intelligence online courses as a subject matter expert. Lourdes is also a Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist; Certified Crypto Forensic Investigator; Certified Fraud Examiner; Certified Chainalysis KYT; CipherTrace Certified Examiner; and ManchesterCF Financial Intelligence Specialist.

**Alani Bankhead** — Lieutenant Colonel & Agent in the Air Force Reserves and Professional Coach & Consultant. Alani Bankhead is a career special agent and professional coach, consultant, and public speaker. With a career spanning almost two decades in federal and state government, Alani has hunted terrorists and spies both in and out of the Middle East on behalf of special operations, was a senior bodyguard to a top Pentagon official, and ultimately found her passion in protecting the most vulnerable — our children — from sexual exploitation. Alani started the Air Force’s Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force mission almost 15 years ago in Japan. And since leaving active duty, she has overseen law enforcement investigations, operations, and hosted national law enforcement training in Latin America for the US’s largest anti-slavery non-profit focusing on the commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) also known as child sexual trafficking. Alani eventually transitioned to Hawaii where she created and led the largest anti-child exploitation cyber operations in the Pacific comprised of federal, state, local, and military law enforcement agencies resulting in the arrest of almost 100 child sex abusers, the identification and recovery of 35+ live child victims, and a 96% conviction or plea rate. Still serving as a Lieutenant Colonel and Agent in the Air Force reserves, Alani currently works as a coach and consultant to enable larger groups of law enforcement and prosecutors to be equipped to handle the growing issue of child exploitation online. Alani has given dozens of conference presentations and talks including a TEDx talk.

This conversation is wide-ranging and touches on essential and difficult topics around how Web3 companies, protocols, and tools preserve privacy and enable freedom—but also potentially enables new attack vectors for bad actors.

This conversation covers far too much ground to transcribe fully in this newsletter. We recommend listening to the entire discussion between Greg Osuri, Lourdes C. Miranda, and Alani Bankhead.
