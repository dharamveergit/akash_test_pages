[**After an incredible 2020 of product, partnership, promotions, and people milestones achieved, our team is accelerating to the DeCloud in 2021!**

](https://akash.network/blog/2020-to-2021-acceleration-to-the-decloud/)Next month, we’ll be launching Mainnet 2, the materialization of Akash DeCloud, the world’s first decentralized cloud, taking on the $370 billion cloud industry currently dominated by Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba Cloud.

Our engineering team has been diligently testing and integrating learnings from The Akashian Challenge Phase 3 Testnet to launch a strong Mainnet 2 in February.

Built on [Cosmos SDK v0.40.0](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.40.0), Akash's upcoming Mainnet 2 includes Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) functionality. IBC will progress our vision for a truly decentralized and interoperable cloud.

**Akash will become** _**the**_ **gateway to the decentralized cloud.**

To support our growth, and to meet ever increasing global demand for access to Akash Token (AKT), we’re relentlessly focused on expanding liquidity for AKT. **Since** [**the IEO on BitMax**](https://akash.network/blog/announcing-akash-mainnet-live-and-bitmax-ieo/) **just over 3 months ago, AKT has 9x-ed in value as of today.**

As the utility token powering [the world’s first DeCloud for DeFi](https://akash.network/blog/akash-decloud-for-defi/) and high growth organizations, **Akash Token (AKT) has ~51% APR staking rewards, and currently enjoys a record-setting ~90% bonding rate.**

Today, we’re excited to announce that more Akashians around the world will be able to access AKT through our upcoming listing on [DigiFinex](https://www.digifinex.com/en-ww/), a world-leading digital assets exchange.

**DigiFinex will list AKT at 18:00 (GMT+8) on Tuesday, January 26, 2020, and open trading of AKT/USDT with 150,000 AKT in rewards.**

[DigiFinex](https://www.digifinex.com/) will be our fourth exchange listing after [BitMax](https://bitmax.io/en/global-digital-asset-platform), [BitMart](https://www.bitmart.com/), and [Bithumb Global](https://www.bithumb.pro/en-us).

We look forward to offering more Akashians around the world access to AKT, and welcoming them into [our community](https://t.me/AkashNW).
