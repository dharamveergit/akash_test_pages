Inspired by an Akash challenge, this guide will show you how to create and set up a Keplr wallet. View the full challenge description [here](https://forum.akash.network/t/create-a-keplr-wallet-guide-win-akt/804) on the Akash Community Forum.

### **Intro**:

When using cryptocurrency, one of the things you need is to set up a “wallet” in order to hold your coins and use them. A wallet is simply software or hardware that enables you to take your cryptocurrency from an exchange (where you buy crypto) and transfer it to a place where it is usable. Using your own wallet instead of storing crypto on an exchange is important because it reduces your risk of losing funds from an exchange hack, and it allows you to deploy your crypto into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications like [Osmosis DEX](https://app.osmosis.zone/) or stake (lock up your funds to secure the network to earn rewards) at higher rates. Exchange wallets are great for buying crypto, non-exchange wallets are better for just about everything else!

The Cosmos Ecosystem has a few compatible wallets, but one that is extremely easy to use is [Keplr](https://keplr.app/). Keplr comes pre-installed with support for Cosmos, Osmosis, Secret Network, Akash Network, Crypto.org, Starname, Sifchain, Certik, Irisnet, Regen, Persistence, Sentinel, Kava, Cyber, and Straightedge. That’s a lot of options! But, in fact, you can actually add any Cosmos-based token through a few extra steps.

This tutorial will show you how to download Keplr on a browser extension. [**Here**](https://youtu.be/8lwmAOaG6LE) **is a YouTube version of this guide where I show you how to download, fund, and trade Akash with a Keplr wallet.** [**Here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGu3wiwcxNc&t=642s) **is my video about how to deploy on Akash with a Keplr wallet.**
