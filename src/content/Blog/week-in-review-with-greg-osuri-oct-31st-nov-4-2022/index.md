Luna’s Akash Terraform Provider
-------------------------------

Akash Insider Luna’s Terraform Provider is gaining traction. Greg highlights that the Provider has received more than 800 downloads. We want to spotlight the work of the incredible Akash community — who do so much work to build the Akash ecosystem.

[Follow Luna on Twitter](https://twitter.com/luna_4_go), and check out the [Terraform Provider here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloud-j-luna/akash/latest/docs).  

Mainnet 4, MASQ, and Urbit
--------------------------

Mainnet 4 enables IP Leases: an open IP marketplace on Akash. IP Leases will open up functionality for projects like Urbit — whose users can host nodes on Akash via IP Leases.

We believe Urbit should run on the decentralized cloud. Stay tuned for the launch announcement of Mainnet 4.

Generative AI & Akash’s upcoming GPU marketplace
------------------------------------------------

Akash Network's vision includes an open marketplace for GPU compute. The current distribution of GPU computing is inefficient, and we believe Akash’s upcoming GPU marketplace will address the exponentially increasing demand.

Akash is working to position itself as the best-in-class marketplace for GPU compute.
