At an accelerating pace, we find more of the ways we connect, play, transact, and work transitioning to the cloud. Developers and organizations need cloud computing and services that enable greater scale, flexibility, and price performance to meet this global demand for throughput and content.

And yet, they continue to have few options beyond the four cloud service providers (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba Cloud).  
  
We set out to build a decentralized alternative, a faster, more efficient, and lower cost cloud--one that would make developers and organizations _unstoppable_.  
  
With the recent launch of Akash Mainnet 1 and our upcoming IEO this month on BitMax, we are much closer to realizing this vision of The Unstoppable Cloud.

We couldn’t have gotten here without your support, and we thank you for joining us on our journey.

For Akashians around the world, this is just the beginning.

On September 25th, we launched Akash Mainnet 1 and announced our upcoming IEO on BitMax, one of the world’s top exchanges. Mainnet 1 is the beginning of Akash DeCloud and network governance, enabling staking and governance operations including the ability to delegate to validators and vote on governance proposals. The auction will begin on October 15th at 10:00am EDT, and the listing will go live on October 16th, at 10:00am EDT. [**Learn More >**

We recently launched a new Token web page to share more information about AKT. Akash Network is a sovereign proof-of-stake chain built on Cosmos Hub, that leverages Akash Token (AKT), a native utility token, as the primary means to govern, secure the blockchain, and provide a default mechanism to store and exchange value. AKT will act as the reserve currency in Akash’s multi-currency and multi-chain ecosystem, while ensuring economic security of the platform’s public blockchain by means of Staking. Check out our new AKT Token page for information on Token supply, staking rewards, and unlock schedule. [**Learn More >**](https://akash.network/token/)

A few weeks ago, we announced an integration with Kava, the first cross-blockchain DeFi platform, to enable Kava’s stablecoin USDX as the first coin for fee settlement on Akash’s DeCloud platform. The integration with Kava will also enable Akash Token (AKT) to be used as collateral for USDX loans.

This integration strengthens AKT’s liquidity and provides Akash users with a stable medium of exchange, while achieving greater adoption for Kava’s stablecoin and an increased debt ceiling from AKT collateral.  [**Learn More >**](https://akash.network/blog/akash-integrates-kava-labss-usdx/)
