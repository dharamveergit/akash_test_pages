## Akash’s Mainnet 4: The governance vote is pending

[The governance proposal is currently out for voting](https://www.mintscan.io/akash/blocks/8526250) and is on track to pass with a 99%+ “yes” vote. If you are an AKT staker, [please vote](https://wallet.keplr.app/chains/akash/proposals/27) to ensure the Mainnet 4 upgrade is completed as scheduled.

The flagship feature of Mainnet 4, a dedicated IP address marketplace, will not only bring Akash closer to parity with large public cloud providers but will also enable new applications and use cases, such as Solana nodes — which have received significant interest over the last few weeks due to recent shocks to the Solana network.

[As Hetzner continues to remove web3 from its platform](https://twitter.com/zacharyhorn/status/1587844722168664064?s=20&t=9mX24LvwGFlgUjn91bhGuA), more projects and protocols realize that now is the time to move to the decentralized cloud. Akash is leading that transition.

We appreciate the recent interest and engagement from the Solana community. We look forward to working together to get Solana nodes up and running on Akash once Mainnet 4 is live.

We also look forward to new features from projects like [MASQ](https://masq.ai/) that Akash’s dedicated IP marketplace will enable.
