**This past month was a month of acceleration for Akash**. After completion of a successful Phase 1 of The Akashian Challenge, our incentivized testnet, we launched the 3 weeks long Phase 2 to test and demonstrate the decentralized exchange features of our cloud platform.

We also expanded our global vision for the future of the cloud and launched our Chinese Community channels with a WeChat AMA hosted by OG Group, broadcast to 5,000 new community members. We’re excited to increase participation in our platform through a new partnership with Lunie Wallet, enabling more users to participate in the economic security of Akash’s blockchain.

It takes a tenacious and talented team to build a future at the intersection of cloud, blockchain, and machine learning. We’re thrilled to welcome our newest team members **Jack Zampolin, Olive Kimoto, Michael Gushansky, and Cheng Wang**. More about each of these extraordinary individuals below.

As more of people’s lives continue to transition to the cloud, our team is even more committed to progressing **a future that provides faster, better, and significantly lower cost access to the cloud, enabling greater growth and innovation for organizations of all sizes.**

Phase 2 of The Akashian Challenge, our incentivized testnet, is [currently underway](https://akash.network/blog/the-akashian-challenge-phase-2-week-2-chaos-is-a-ladder/) and **encompasses 3 weeks of challenges, 600,000 AKT rewards, and special prizes.**

The Akashian Challenge Phase 2 introduces, demonstrates, and tests the decentralized exchange features of Akash. This decentralized exchange (DEX) is different from others in the cryptocurrency world, which are focused on settling trades; the Akash DEX is designed to settle requests for application deployments.

We’re excited to announce an integration and partnership with Lunie Wallet. Lunie is a non-custodial staking tool that allows users to safely store, manage and stake crypto assets in Proof of Stake (PoS) networks.

We’ve been admirers of Lunie’s user experience, ease of set-up, and deep integration with Cosmos validators. As a trusted wallet in the Cosmos ecosystem, Lunie provides a great user interface to simplify delegation, voting, and staking.

With a reputable and high integrity team led by CEO Jordan Bibla, Lunie is a company we’d wanted to partner with to enable more users to participate in the economic security of Akash’s blockchain.
