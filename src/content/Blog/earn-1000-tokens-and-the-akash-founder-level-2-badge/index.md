### **First Challenge Results!**

Last Wednesday, Nov. 6th, we shared Akash’s Founder Level 1: First Challenge in [our blog article](https://akash.network/blog/become-and-akash-founding-member-and-earn-token-rewards/). The challenge was to deploy an end-to-end encrypted chat client on Akash and attach a custom domain. And the world rose to the challenge! We had incredible participation from around the world, and gained Founding Member hopefuls from the U.S., Korea, Japan, China, Europe, India, and South America.

### **Introducing Akash Founder Level 2 Second Challenge: Deploy Your Own Private Matrix Server**

This week, we present the Second Challenge, which qualifies you to earn 1,000 Akash Tokens (AKT).  
  
Akash is a marketplace for cloud compute that’s encrypted, private, and decentralized, and an important benefit of deployment on Akash  is private communications for your community or team.   
  
Last week we introduced a way for you to have an end-to-end encrypted chat server, and this week, we’ll enable you to deploy your own private matrix server with complete sovereignty over your communications. A matrix server is an open network to secure decentralized communication. It is normally very expensive and difficult to manage. But not on Akash Network.
