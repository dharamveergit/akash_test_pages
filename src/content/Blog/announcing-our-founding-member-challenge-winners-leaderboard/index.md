Four weeks ago, we launched the Akash Founding Member Rewards Program for early contributors to Akash’s testnet and community. The program involved 3 progressively difficult challenges along with bonus challenges, and contributors joined from all over the world, including the U.S., Korea, Japan, China, Europe, India, and South America.  
  
**Deploying on the World’s First Supercloud for Serverless Computing**  
  
Each challenge had a corresponding reward, for a total of 3,500 Akash Tokens (AKT), with bonuses of up to 2,000 AKT.  

*   **1st Challenge, Level 1**: Deploy an end-to-end encrypted chat client on Akash. [Details](https://github.com/ovrclk/ecosystem/blob/master/founders/level1/README.md).
    
*   **2nd Challenge, Level 2:** Deploy a secure, decentralized, real-time messaging service on Akash. [Details](https://github.com/ovrclk/ecosystem/blob/master/founders/level2/README.md).
    
*   **3rd Challenge, Level 3:** Sell your spare capacity on Akash. [Details](https://github.com/ovrclk/ecosystem/blob/master/founders/level3/README.md).
    

The challenges engaged contributors with Akash Network, the world’s first supercloud for serverless computing, and taught them how to deploy on our open, permissionless, and secure marketplace for compute cycles.   
  
Contributors from around the world worked together to help each other complete challenges. Admittedly, all this collaboration made us warm and fuzzy, and this is the community we envisioned when we set out to build Akash.   
  
**Wall of Love**  
  
The Founding Member Challenges ended last Friday, December 13th, and the warm and fuzzies continued on our Wall of Love:

**Congratulations to the Winners of our Founding Member Rewards Challenges!**  
  
Today, we’re excited to announce the Founder Badge winners of our Founding Member Rewards Program Challenges listed in the top leaderboard below.

We’re impressed by the resourcefulness, patience, collaboration, and grit that was displayed these past four weeks by our winners!  
  
We recognize that there are other ways of contributing to Akash’s community, such as helping others navigate through the challenges, or sharing technical guides.
