Akash Network and Polygon join forces with a bounty matching program that offers the Polygon Ecosystem a path from traditional cloud to cloud providers on Akash Network. Akash’s peer-to-peer marketplace offers Polygon developers a cost-effective option to deploy and scale their applications and services while Polygon provides [a starter kit](https://polygontechnology.notion.site/Polygon-Starter-Kit-a289a505a0bb4e8b8189c1fc3b2223d0) to developers including instructions for hosting on Akash Network.

[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), is a full-stack scaling solution built to improve Ethereum by processing transactions in a more efficient fashion and connecting different blockchains. This provides a way for developers to let their decentralized applications, or dApps, work across different blockchains.

### **Making dApps More Decentralized**

The benefit of moving to Akash is that decentralized application (dApp) developers can deploy their existing software faster and at scale while eliminating their reliance on a single cloud provider.

By running their dApps across multiple cloud providers, developers break free of the vendor lock-in and constantly changing terms of service associated with the traditional cloud companies. The lower costs on Akash Network bring welcomed cost-savings, making it an easy decision for developers who are tied to the centralized internet giants, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

Most cloud-native applications running on the cloud today can run on Akash Network.

For end-users, this promises to result in more dApps that are “fully decentralized” and more robust. Should a provider shut down, dApps can quickly spin up a new container deployment on a different provider. Thanks to Akash Network, the steps to switch cloud providers are closing a deployment and then creating a new lease. The deposit is returned immediately, and the only fees incurred are signing the blockchain transactions. Akash lets you set the price, length of lease, and terms of your deployment.

### **Web3 and DeFi Working Together**

More than 70% of Polygon’s 700 dApps are related to decentralized finance (DeFi) and provide investing, lending, and other financial services. Developers are also building dApps for gaming, collecting (NFTs), social platforms, blogs, and more.

DeFi companies and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are a natural fit for the Akash Network. Like DeFi and DAOs, Akash is founded on the principle of permissionless, open access and does not decide who can use the marketplace. Akash is a community-driven open-source project that allows anyone to contribute.

### **The Akash Polygon-athon**

Dubbed the Akash Polygon-athon, Akash has launched a new program specifically for dApps running on Polygon’s network. All developers in the Polygon ecosystem are now incentivized to migrate away from the traditional cloud providers and move their back-end and front-end services to the Akash Network.

- Akash is offering 20 $AKT to any Polygon ecosystem project to cover the cost of hosting on Akash. If you are a developer, check out the [Polygon Starter Kit](https://akashnet.notion.site/Polygon-Akash-Starter-Kit-d4e817023556417ea8c9b679336d0d76) to get started.

- To put things in perspective, this covers roughly 2-3 months of hosting costs for an application with 4 cores, 16 GB RAM, and 1 GB of storage - OR - up to 20 microservices.

- Akash will _**match**_ bounties posted by Polygon projects - up to 100 $AKT. If a project offers a bounty of 100 $AKT or more, Akash will match the bounty with an additional 100 $AKT, and the person hired to the bounty will be awarded 200 $AKT.

- Polygon apps can immediately post a bounty on the Akash Bounty Board ([click here](https://forum.akash.network/c/bounties/)) to hire engineers to help them with the DevOps effort of migration and hosting on Akash.

- Bounties by projects can be paid in any currency. Matching awards by Akash will be paid in $AKT.

Further, developers are encouraged to apply for up to $100,000 from the Akash Developer Grant Program, which will be welcoming projects running on Polygon. Support for Polygon dApps will be funded through a bounty hosted by Akash and Gitcoin. Visit the [Akash Community Forum](https://forum.akash.network/c/hackathons/polygon/56) to learn how to apply for the program.
