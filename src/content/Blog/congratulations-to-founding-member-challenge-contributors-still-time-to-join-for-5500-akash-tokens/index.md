Congratulations to our Founding Member Challenge Contributors! With one week left to go, we’re excited to announce all those who have completed our Akash Founding Member Rewards Program 3 Challenges so far, and we encourage those who haven’t yet, to join now–you still have time! Much respect to those going the distance and completing the difficult 3rd Challenge to achieve the coveted Founding Member badge.  
  
Three weeks ago, we launched the Akash Founding Member Rewards Program for contributors to Akash’s testnet and as a warm thank you to our community. Since then, we’ve had contributors join from all over the world, including the U.S., Korea, Japan, China, Europe, India, and South America. As a reminder, the program involves 3 challenges and each challenge has a corresponding reward, for a total of 3,500 Akash Tokens (AKT), with bonuses of up to 2,000 AKT.    
  
The Founding Member Challenges **end this Friday, December 13th at 5PM PST, and we’ll be announcing the winners next Tuesday, December 17th**.   
  
**If you haven’t participated yet, you can still do so, as all three challenges are still open** **and** [**instructions are available for all 3 Challenges**.](https://github.com/ovrclk/ecosystem/blob/master/README.md)

Here’s a bit of love from contributors:
