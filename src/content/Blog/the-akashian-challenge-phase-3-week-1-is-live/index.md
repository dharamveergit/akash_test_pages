#### **Goals & Overview**

**\_\_\_\_\_**

Integrating performance enhancements from Cosmos SDK v0.40, The Akashian Challenge Testnet 3 will test and showcase Akash DeCloud’s deployment platform. Akashian Challengers will be incentivized to deploy applications using the Akash Network.

Encompassing two weeks, Phase 3 will include **guided challenges** for deploying applications of increasing complexity — from simple single-page applications to blockchain network components, and **open ended challenges** where users can show off their Akash OPS skills by extending the guided examples to deploy any application they desire — from DeFi to CI.

There are additional rewards for participation outside of the deployment challenges, including contributions such as active validator participation, writing blog posts and how-to guides, and sharing novel uses of our platform.

**Phase 3 Goals:**

- Test platform functionality for Mainnet 2
- Distribute tokens to potential users for Mainnet 2
- Build a catalog of applications (SDLs) to launch Mainnet 2

**Phase 3 Challenges:**

- Guided Challenges

  - These challenges are meant to be used as step-by-step guides to deploying applications on our network.
  - Each challenge will have accompanying instructions and example deployment configurations.

- Open Ended Challenges

  - As a generic cloud platform, Akash DeCloud has the potential to be used in a wide variety of use cases. This open-ended challenge is meant to explore what kinds of applications can be deployed on DeCloud, and how.
  - You’ll support the Akash DeCloud community by finding unique applications to deploy and sharing your deployment configuration via a pull request on Awesome Akash.

- Network Support Challenges

  - While validators and other network components are not necessarily targeted in this testnet, they are of course essential to maintaining a healthy DeCloud.
  - Leverage this testnet to practice your operations, or try new ones.
  - To earn rewards for this challenge, you should be actively participating — keep your component(s) up-to-date and respond to any network proposals that may come up.

- Community Content Challenges

  - Drop your knowledge about Akash DeCloud to earn rewards. The community content challenges support community members who independently publish articles and guides related to the Akash Network.

    - **Anything Goes**: An open-ended category where "Anything Goes!" with community-generated content related to Akash.
    - **DeCloud for DeFi**: A category calling on our community to leverage Akash DeCloud as the infrastructure supporting DeFi applications.

Phase 3 will accelerate our vision for a decentralized and open cloud computing marketplace and serve as the launchpad for Mainnet 2.
