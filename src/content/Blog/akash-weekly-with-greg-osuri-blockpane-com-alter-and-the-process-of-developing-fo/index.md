The Ethos of a Validator
------------------------

Todd provides his background as a validator and his journey to Cosmos. From both his and the community’s perspectives, a validator is responsible for more than just making blocks. There is a responsibility to make the ecosystem better. One way to do that is by building tools that seek to answer a question.

For Todd, the genesis of his [Cosmissed](https://blockpane.com/projects.html) tool came from the question: “Why are people missing blocks?” 

From this question, many more arose as the tool evolved. He notes that asking these seeking questions brings forward valuable information that makes it easier to build for the right audience. Greg agrees, having built many apps that started as a desire to fulfill a personal need. He says that even years later, he finds many of those apps very useful, and nostalgic in a way. Sometimes, those apps end up finding a wider audience. 

Why Do Some Developers Continue to Choose web2 Cloud Providers?
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is an interesting and complex topic that has been brought up by guests on previous Akash Weekly segments.

The answer, according to Todd (and echoed by previous guests), is that hyperscale cloud providers are familiar to many developers—who often have deep experience with these platforms. Even though these legacy services may not be the best fit for certain projects, some developers continue to return to what they know.

But this is changing. Many developers are beginning to run their nodes and applications on decentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces like Akash Network—often achieving the same performance for a fraction of the cost.

Todd mentions that he avoids running more than one validator in the same data center. This way, if there are outages, it reduces the impact of the problem. “This way I only have one problem, not six,” he says. This is one way that developers can begin to spread out risk and achieve a semblance of decentralization. For those looking to achieve an even greater decentralization of their workloads, Akash Network makes it easy to deploy seamlessly across many different providers. 

In addition, many developers have mentioned the addition of persistent storage on Akash Network as a key reason for moving more workloads over to Akash.

A Scalable, Private Infrastructure Layer
----------------------------------------

Oskar gives a run-through of Alter, which is a scalable, private infrastructure layer that supports web3 communities. They have focused on maintaining the highest security and privacy standards.

Alter is focusing on decentralizing its file storage infrastructure, and working on ways to give users the most choice in controlling the security of their data. They are also exploring options to work with Akash to offer users more control and sovereignty over their data and communications.

**Managing to GDPR.** Oskar notes that Alter is not subject to GDPR regulations because they do not process user data—as all the data that Alter works with uses E2EE (End to End Encryption). This not only reduces Alter’s regulatory burden but is also a function of the ways that Alter protects and preserves user privacy.

As Oskar notes, “web3 can only happen if we collaborate with each other. Otherwise, it is not possible to reach our common goal—which is a decentralized web space."

Which Tools Does web3 Need Now?
-------------------------------

web3 is currently highly dependent on Github, which is owned by Microsoft. This centralized service becomes a single point of failure if there are outages, or if takedown notices are issued. Cloudflare also has a significant concentration of websites and applications.

A major risk to the entire decentralization movement is the reliance on centralized cloud providers. Chainstack estimates that the top ten cloud providers of Ethereum nodes amount to nearly 60% of all nodes on the network. AWS alone hosts nearly 25% of all nodes on the network.

Reliance on centralized infrastructure poses significant risks to the stability and sovereignty of all systems and networks that aim to be decentralized. Based on this data from the Ethereum network—an AWS outage would take down nearly a quarter of the entire network. 

Akash provides the foundational layer that provides decentralization at the base layer. This opens the opportunity for developers to build applications on truly decentralized infrastructure, without having to sacrifice sovereignty by defaulting to hyperscale providers.

Q&A

### Q: Are there plans to launch incentive programs with AKT?

We will have future plans to launch incentives, but there are no current plans. We are focusing on revamping our AKT tokenomics.
