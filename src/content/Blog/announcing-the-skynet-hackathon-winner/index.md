In June, we announced an integration with Skynet Labs to provide the first full-stack decentralized web (dWeb) solution to handle backup, restore, and migration.

Bringing together the compute and storage layers, with Akash Network providing decentralized compute, and Skynet Labs providing decentralized storage, developers can host their applications on a fully decentralized cloud. The developer communities also benefit from the network effect; as more users and developers switch to a decentralized architecture, more contributions are made to these open-source projects.

As a part of this integration, [we offered $10,000 to the developer or team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2pVpefAtA8) that builds the best app that integrates Skynet and Akash. 

From submissions that make it easier to deploy on Akash to anonymous messages stored in a MySQL database to prank your friends, we had a ton of great submissions. 

### **The Runner-Ups** 

#### **AkashNS by figurestudios**

AkashNS makes Node.js deployments easier for developers who may be new to Docker. Including environment variables, AkashNS allows changes to the deployment .yml file with a few different variables rather than rebuilding their own images. This makes it so that most users with a basic tech understanding will be able to utilize the Akashlytics Deployment Tool to get their app hosted on Akash.

To see the bot in action join [this Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/F95xQ2xKat).

You can see the full AkashNS project submission [here](https://forum.akash.network/t/akashns-making-node-js-deployments-easier/916). 

#### **Capsule by aldin**

Capsule is a decentralized alternative to Pastebin with more features, utilizing real-time Skynet backups and decentralization with Akash as the backend for discovery. Leveraging properties of decentralization, Capsule has no single source of authority, making it secure and private. See the full submission, [here](https://forum.akash.network/t/challenge-decentralized-alternative-to-pastebin/).

#### **Grafana Plugin by humanoid**

A proposal to work on a data source plugin for the Grafana open-source dashboard and monitoring project. 

See the full proposal [here](https://forum.akash.network/t/project-proposal-grafana-datasource-plugin/). 

#### **OpenRegistry by JasdeepSingh**

Hosted on Akash and powered by SkyNet, OpenRegistry is a decentralized container registry fully compliant with OCI Distribution Specification which means now you can use all the features of existing container registries on OpenRegistry.

As a part of the Skynet Challenge, OpenRegistry added 3 major features, fixed a few bugs, and provided both memory and storage optimizations. New features include:

*   Concurrent image uploads
    
*   Authenticate with OpenRegistry using Docker CLI (or any other container tools like podman)
    
*   Push Container Images
    
*   Pull Container Images
    

OpenRegistry is accepting users for a closed beta program at Parachute by OpenRegistry 21. Feel free to register for the beta program [here](https://parachute.openregistry.dev/).

#### **Skynet Akash Image Library by zJu**

This project shows you how to host a decentralized platform with static files stored on Skynet and the backend running on Akash Network. The Skynet Akash Image Library allows users to upload images while others either up or downvote them. If the number of votes falls below a certain value, it will be removed. Skynet Akash Image Library also has a server that temporarily stores the files and uploads them again, if necessary.

#### **Secret Message by developerpiyush**

Secret Message is a website that allows you to send and receive encrypted messages from your friends. Through Secret Message, anyone can create and send messages through a unique link that gets stored in a MySQL database with a foreign key that links to its owner. When the owner of the link logs in to see messages, they can see all the anonymous messages that they received. Hence the name, Secret Message. If you’d like to try it out yourself, send your own secret message using [this link](http://j00j6ner7pdkb86le6mhhgm3ug.ingress.provider-0.prod.ams1.akash.pub/message.php?name=piyush_).

### **Introducing the 1st Place Winner**

#### **SkyChat by redsolver**

SkyChat, a decentralized version of Discord, uses MySky to let users login in a permissionless and decentralized way. With MySky, every user fully owns their key pair, which is the root of their decentralized identity. You can learn more about MySky from Skynet Labs CEO, David Vorick [here](https://blog.sia.tech/mysky-your-home-on-the-global-operating-system-of-the-future-5a288f89825c).
