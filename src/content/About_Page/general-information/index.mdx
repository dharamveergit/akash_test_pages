The Akash Network comprises key components: Akash Providers, managing infrastructure and Kubernetes clusters; Akash Network, a versatile platform similar to Airbnb for data centers, offering cost-efficiency, choice, standardized resources, open-source principles, and community involvement; and Akash Tenants, deploying apps as Docker containers, benefiting from decentralized deployment. Together, they form the Akash Network's foundation.

### How cloud providers operate today

The traditional cloud service model, as seen with industry leaders like AWS, contrasts with Akash Network's innovative approach. In the traditional model, a single provider owns and controls infrastructure, limiting customization and pricing options. Users often face vendor lock-in, lengthy contracts, and high costs for infrastructure development (CoLo). In comparison, Akash offers more infrastructure flexibility and cost-effectiveness.

### Challenges of decentralized cloud deployment

Decentralized cloud deployment offers diverse infrastructure choices, but providers struggle with underutilization and the absence of an on-demand marketplace. This leads to non-standardized deployment processes and a challenging user experience. However, Akash Network's innovative approach addresses these challenges, resulting in a streamlined, cost-effective, and accessible cloud ecosystem.
