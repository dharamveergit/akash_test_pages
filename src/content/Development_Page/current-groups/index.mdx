The Akash Network community groups are insipired by the Kubernetes project and currently consist of the following groups. As our community evolves, we will consider changing this structure as needed. All groups listed below are open to anyone interested in participating in them, except “Committees” that have preassigned members.

## Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

## User Groups (UGs)
