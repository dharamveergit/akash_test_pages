These are all the projects that are currently in some state ranging from “ideation” to “release”. To understand the various states see the table at the bottom of this page.

### General guidelines for updating this table

- Projects that are in some working state (ideation or beyond) should have a link to their specific sig or wg page (can even just be a github issue inside the repo for the sig) from the “Project Name”
- Projects that are in a working state should have a label specified here and linked to a filtered list of github issues for that label
- Projects that are in a working state should be assigned to a SIG or WG
- Projects that are not even in ideation (not in a working state) should have a name and a brief description

### Project States

A project may be in one of these states. Note that every project does NOT have to touch every one of these states and some projects may remain in a given state for a long time (like an idea that never gets any interest from the community to implement and remains in “ideation” for a long time).
